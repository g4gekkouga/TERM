DBMS Course Project
Project Abstract : 

The purpose of this project is to automate the venue booking, student or user registration for various events in IIT Kharagpur. These activities are very frequent on our campus. Manually verifying the availability and taking permissions from different authorities is very time taking. This project can assist the event manager to concentrate on their other activities rather than to concentrate on the record keeping. Basic functionalities of this project include :

1)List of available venues on the event date
2)Online booking request and payment for the venue
3)Requesting required authorities for permissions
4)List of active requests for different authorities
5)Acceptance or Rejection for a request
6)Event details for the users
7)Registration for upcoming events
8)Records of registered users for an event
9)Other basic functionalities like login, registration, profile updation for users, admin, authority, event etc

The main aim of this project is to minimize the time put into management of an event and to maintain computerized records of event details without any conflicts and redundancy.
